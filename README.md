Netwerk, a professional networking website that combines key features of LinkedIn and Tinder. Users can create profiles (either as an employer or job candidate) and view profiles of the opposite type (i.e candidates view jobs, employers view candidates). Users can then swipe left or right on a given profile to express interest, with a right swipe meaning “interested” and a left swipe meaning “not interested”. If two users swipe right on each other, they “match,” and the users can contact each other about hiring opportunities.
