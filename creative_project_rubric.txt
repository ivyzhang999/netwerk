Description: A tinder-like app that connects people with jobs. Users can set up 
either a job profile or a candidate profile and view profiles of the opposite type. 
Users can "like" a job or candidate and if the interest is mutual, both parties will be 
alerted. Each user will maintain a list of matches.
